Smooth muscle cells (SMC) play significant roles in atherosclerosis via phenotypic switching, a pathological process in which SMC dedifferentiation, migration and transdifferentiation into other cell types. Yet, how SMC contribute to pathophysiology of atherosclerosis remains elusive. To reveal the trajectories of SMC transdifferentiation during atherosclerosis and to identify molecular targets for disease therapy, we combined SMC fate mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing of both mouse and human atherosclerotic plaques.

Atherogenesis involves an interplay of inflammation, tissue remodeling and cellular transdifferentiation (CTD), making it especially difficult to precisely delineate its pathophysiology. Here we examine the single-cell transcriptome of entire calcified atherosclerotic core (AC) plaques and patient-matched proximal adjacent (PA) portions of carotid artery tissue from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. We use a novel tissue dissociation strategy, single-cell RNA sequencing, and systems-biology approaches to analyze the transcriptional profiles of six main cell populations and identify key gene drivers of pathogenic biological processes in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs).

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a complex inflammatory disease involving genetic influences across several cell types. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 170 loci associated with CAD, where the majority of risk variants reside in noncoding DNA sequences impacting cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Here, we applied single-cell ATAC-seq to profile 28,316 cells across coronary artery segments from 41 patients with varying stages of CAD, which revealed 14 distinct cellular clusters. We mapped ~320,000 accessible sites across all cells, identified cell type-specific elements, transcription factors, and prioritized functional CAD risk variants via quantitative trait locus and sequence-based predictive modeling. We identified a number of candidate mechanisms for smooth muscle cell transition states and identified putative binding sites for risk variants. We further employed CRE to gene linkage to nominate disease-associated key driver transcription factors such as PRDM16 and TBX2. This single cell atlas provides a critical step towards interpreting cis-regulatory mechanisms in the vessel wall across the continuum of CAD risk.
